This is ChattR, a simple chat application made during my trial and error at learning socket.io.

This is the result of many hours of sifting through videos and what little documentation I could find about socket.io, 
playing around and breaking my code a few times, and ultimately learning.

Just goes to show you that even if you don't understand the material too much, just keep at it till it makes sense!


todo possiblities:
  - add a password protected login to the website
  - timestamps for messages
  - make messages round instead of square
  - add other rooms instead of just one?
  - private 1-1 message capabilities between users
